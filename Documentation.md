This application helps you to select a car that fits your needs. 

This app uses 'mtcars' dataset from 'datasets' package in R that lists 10 automobile design and performance details of 32 cars. 

You need to set the cost of gasoline of the required area & the distance of your trip so that it measures the "gasoline expenditure" for each car in the dataset. 
You can also set max. expenditure of the gasoline to which reactive response in the app shows the cars with the suitable milage (mpg(Miles per gallon)).
Moreover, you can also select some characteristics of the cars that you prefer like Cylinders, Displacement, Horse Power and Transmission.
